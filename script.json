    "FRONTEND" : "His frontend development majorly comprises of Web 2.0 apps(SPA) which focuses on decoupling client and server.\n He prefers client side rendering and thinks server side rendering is thing of the past and should be used only if clent side rendering does not work. %[AngularJs 1.x](postback:angular)",
    "ANGULARJS 1.X" : "Level : 6/10 \n He has built multiple dashboards for various clients like Rekart, Instspaces, SamasyaHal.\n He loves Restangular and favours gulp over grunt because gulp seems fast to him, maybe he loves writing code required in the gulpfile. \n He has also built a Yeoman generator for scaffolding new Angular Projects https://github.com/naqvijafar91/angularjs-generator . He built that after researching and implementing best practices of Angular 1.x",

    "BACKEND" :"Jafar likes backend the most, he tries to throw as much processing on the server as possible and is a strong believer of REST. \n He wants that client machines should just have enough power to run a successfull internet connection. \n And so, his broadest skill set - he has worked on Express,SailsJs,PHP,Codeigniter,JSP/Servlets, Go Programming Language and MySql and MongoDb for database %[NodeJs/Express](postback:node_express) %[NodeJs/SailsJs](postback:node_sails) %[JSP/Servlets](postback:jsp_Servlets)",

    "NODEJS/SAILSJS" : " Level 7.5/10 \n He heard about sails in the nodejs weekly newsletter, and since then there has been no looking back. \n Transition from Mongoose to Waterline was a breeze, along with Bluebird.js - A promises library.
